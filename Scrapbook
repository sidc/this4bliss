Admin: das, haribol

14 February
1. Setup the environment and libraries for django

To Do:
1. Think on paper about the databases
2. Find out more on unit testing in Django

27th March
1. Finallized the models and saved them to the DB

Note:
I am using very simple category system. There is a library available for handling taxonomy named django categories.
I may use that in future.

For the file download links, in future I may have to work with the admin interface so that the administrator can 
upload files and the links would automatically appear. 

28 April
1. Try summernote. 

Next step:
1. Change two things in admin interface:
	http://djangosuit.com/admin/examples/kitchensink/
	WYSIWYG or some kind of editor for content
	File upload option to static


2. Go to tutorial part 3 and write basic views 
3. Write forms for users to add comments and karma to items
4. Write tests to ensure I donot break stuff in future
